## 🏥 Backstory

St. Mary's Hospital, a small rural facility with 80 beds, 2 doctors, and 9 nurses, faced a growing challenge: long and unpredictable gaps between staff visits. These delays impacted patient satisfaction and care quality.

To address this, our team built **Lean On Me**—a lightweight, data-driven dashboard that monitors inpatient wait times, flags delays, and empowers staff to rebalance workloads in real time.
