# Closing the 8-Hour Care Gap: Real-Time Staff Rebalancing Cuts Patient Wait Times by 40%

**SYSEN 5300 Six Sigma Hackathon 2025 - Cornell University**

---

## Backstory
Nestled in a quiet corner of rural New York, our hospital is small but mighty. With just 80 beds, 2 dedicated doctors, and a team of 9 nurses, we serve a tight-knit community that relies on us for compassionate and consistent care. But like many under-resourced facilities, we face challenges that larger hospitals often overlook—especially when it comes to coordinating staff across floors.

Patients have increasingly voiced concerns about long and unpredictable gaps between staff visits during their inpatient stays. These delays not only affect their perception of care but can also lead to extended hospitalizations and missed treatment opportunities. With limited personnel and no existing system to track these interactions, we knew something had to change.

That's why our team developed **Lean On Me**—a lightweight, data-driven quality control system designed to monitor inpatient wait times, flag excessive delays, and empower staff to respond more efficiently. Built during the SYSEN 5300 Hackathon, this tool simulates hospital workflows using synthetic data and applies Six Sigma principles to help small hospitals like ours deliver big improvements in care.

## Background: The Hospital Context

### Facility Profile

**St. Mary's Hospital - Floor 3 (Medical-Surgical Unit)**

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bed Capacity** | 80 beds across 20 rooms (Rooms 301-320) |
| **Patient Volume** | 60-80 patients daily (75-100% occupancy) |
| **Services Provided** | Post-surgical care, chronic disease management, pre-discharge observation |
| **Staffing** | 2 physicians, 9 nurses (6 on duty per shift) |
| **Schedule** | 24/7 operations, three 8-hour shifts (7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 11pm-7am) |
| **Nurse-Patient Ratio** | 1:6 (industry standard for med-surg floors) |
| **Average Length of Stay** | 3-5 days |

### Current System Setup

**Patient Flow Process:**
1. **Admission** (30 min): Patient transferred from ER/ICU → Assigned room and nurse
2. **Initial Assessment** (20 min): Baseline vitals, medical history, acuity classification
3. **Routine Care Delivery** (5-30 min per visit): Medication, vitals, wound care, patient education
4. **Discharge Planning** (begins Day 1): Social work, prescriptions, follow-up appointments
5. **Discharge** (45 min): Final assessment, paperwork, patient education, billing settlement

**Shift Assignments:**
- **Current practice:** Charge nurse assigns patients at shift start based on "gut feeling" and bed proximity
- **No systematic workload balancing**
- **No real-time visibility** into visit frequency or gaps

**Billing Integration:**
- Visits documented in EMR system
- Charges calculated based on visit type and duration
- Insurance pre-authorization required for extended stays (>5 days)
- Patient billing settled at discharge

## Problem Scope

### Empathize: Understanding the Human Pain Points

We conducted interviews with three key stakeholder groups:

#### **Patients (n=15 interviews)**
> "I pressed my call button 3 times. Nobody came for 8 hours. I was in pain and scared."
> 
> "The nurse on the previous shift checked on me every 2 hours. Today's nurse, I haven't seen her once in 6 hours."

**Pain points:**
- Unpredictable visit frequency creates anxiety
- High-acuity patients feel neglected
- Family members complain about inconsistent communication

#### **Nurses (n=9 interviews)**
> "When I'm assigned 12 patients and Sarah only has 4, I'm drowning while she's sitting at the nurses' station."
>
> "By hour 6 of my shift, I'm so behind that I'm just triaging the emergencies and everyone else waits."

**Pain points:**
- Workload imbalance causes burnout
- No visibility into colleagues' patient loads
- Guilt over missed checks but unable to "clone themselves"
- High turnover ($88,000 cost to replace one nurse)

#### **Charge Nurses (n=3 interviews)**
> "I assign patients based on who's available and which rooms are close together. I have no way to know if I'm overloading someone until they tell me—and by then, patients have been waiting hours."

**Pain points:**
- No data-driven assignment tool
- Reactive rather than proactive management
- Patient complaints rolling in after the damage is done
- Pressure from administration to improve quality metrics

### Define: Framing the Problem

**Problem Statement:**
Irregular patient care gaps (ranging from 2 to 8+ hours between visits) occur on Floor 3 despite adequate staffing, caused by inefficient workload distribution during shift assignments, resulting in:
- 72% compliance rate (target: >95%)
- 37.5% of patients exceeding care thresholds
- Patient complaints tripling over 6 months
- Nurse turnover at 23% (industry avg: 15%)

**Root Cause:** Process deficiency in workload distribution, NOT resource deficiency.

## 🎯 Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Users & Use Cases

| Stakeholder | Role | Primary Use Case | Key Needs | Dashboard Tab |
|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Charge Nurses** | Real-time operational decisions | Monitor critical alerts, execute reassignments during shift | Immediate visibility into threshold violations; actionable recommendations | Tab 1: Live Dashboard |
| **Nurse Managers** | Shift planning & workload balancing | Review variance metrics, plan future assignments | Proactive workload distribution tools; historical trend data | Tab 2: Staff Workload |
| **Floor Nurses** | Direct patient care delivery | Check assigned patients, prioritize visits | Clear patient status; acuity-coded priorities | Tab 3: Patient Details |
| **Quality Teams** | Long-term performance tracking | Analyze compliance trends, identify systemic issues | Control charts; compliance rate trends; exportable reports | Tab 1 + Tab 2 |
| **Hospital Administration** | Resource allocation decisions | Review ROI, nurse retention metrics, patient satisfaction | Cost-benefit analysis; outcome metrics; evidence for staffing decisions | About Tab + Reports |

### User Journey Mapping

#### **Scenario 1: Pre-Shift Planning (Charge Nurse)**
1. Opens dashboard 15 minutes before shift start
2. Reviews current patient census and acuity distribution
3. Algorithm recommends balanced assignments (e.g., N01: 6 patients, 15 acuity points)
4. Approves assignments and communicates to incoming nurses
5. **Result:** Workload variance of 2.3 (target: <4.0)

#### **Scenario 2: Mid-Shift Alert Response (Floor Nurse)**
1. Receives dashboard notification: Patient P042 exceeds 2-hour threshold (High Acuity)
2. Checks dashboard → Confirms CRITICAL status (9.5 hours since last visit)
3. Prioritizes visit immediately
4. Conducts assessment and logs visit completion
5. **Result:** Timer resets; alert clears from dashboard

#### **Scenario 3: Workload Rebalancing (Charge Nurse)**
1. Dashboard shows N12 with 12 patients (28 acuity points) - OVERLOADED
2. Dashboard recommends: Move P058 (Low Acuity) from N12 → N03 (8 acuity points)
3. Charge nurse approves reassignment
4. Updates assignment in dashboard
5. **Result:** Workload variance drops from 6.8 → 3.2

#### **Scenario 4: Post-Shift Review (Quality Team)**
1. Reviews daily compliance rate: 94% (up from 72% baseline)
2. Identifies remaining 6% non-compliance: All occurred 11pm-7am shift
3. Generates report for night shift staffing evaluation
4. **Result:** Evidence-based recommendation for night shift protocol changes

### Why-Why Analysis: Drilling to Root Cause

**Problem:** Patient P042 (High Acuity) waited 9.5 hours between visits

**Why #1:** Why did P042 wait 9.5 hours?
- Because assigned nurse (N12) didn't visit

**Why #2:** Why didn't N12 visit?
- Because N12 was handling 12 patients and couldn't get to everyone

**Why #3:** Why did N12 have 12 patients?
- Because charge nurse assigned 12 patients to N12 at shift start

**Why #4:** Why did charge nurse assign 12 patients to N12?
- Because charge nurse used room proximity (rooms 301-312) rather than workload balance

**Why #5:** Why did charge nurse use room proximity instead of workload balance?
- Because **no system exists to calculate real-time workload or recommend balanced assignments**

**ROOT CAUSE:** Lack of data-driven workload distribution system

## Ideate: Solution Brainstorming

Following Design Thinking methodology, we generated multiple solution concepts:

| Solution Idea | Pros | Cons | Selected? |
|---------------|------|------|-----------|
| **Hire more nurses** | Increases capacity | Costs $520K/year for 8 FTEs; doesn't fix distribution problem | ❌ |
| **Fixed patient limits** | Simple (max 8 per nurse) | Ignores acuity; low-acuity patients easier than high | ❌ |
| **Manual reassignment protocol** | Low-tech solution | Requires continuous monitoring; reactive not proactive | ❌ |
| **Real-time monitoring dashboard** | Proactive; data-driven; scalable | Requires tech development | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| **Acuity-weighted assignment algorithm** | Balances difficulty, not just count | Needs accurate acuity scoring | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |
| **Automated alerts & recommendations** | Immediate response to gaps | Could create alert fatigue if not tuned properly | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |

**Selected Solution:** Real-time quality control dashboard with acuity-weighted workload balancing and intelligent reassignment recommendations.

## 📊 Test Datasets

Our tool includes three synthetic datasets that demonstrate the system's effectiveness across different scenarios:

### Dataset 1: Baseline Scenario (Current State)
- **Files:** Built-in mock data (auto-generated when app runs)
- **Description:** 80 patients with unbalanced workload distribution
  - Nurse N12: 12 patients (28 acuity points) - OVERLOADED
  - Nurse N03: 4 patients (8 acuity points) - UNDERUTILIZED
  - Workload variance: 6.8
  - Compliance rate: 72%
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates the problem state before intervention
- **Key Insight:** Shows how poor assignment leads to long wait times (avg 5.8 hours)

### Dataset 2: High Acuity Surge (Stress Test)
- **Scenario:** Hypothetical surge with 30% high-acuity patients (vs. 15% normal)
- **Description:** Simulates flu season or mass casualty event
  - 24 high-acuity patients (vs. 12 baseline)
  - 40 medium-acuity, 16 low-acuity
  - Tests alert system under extreme conditions
- **Purpose:** Validates that dashboard can handle worst-case scenarios
- **Expected Outcome:** More frequent alerts, but system prevents catastrophic delays

### Dataset 3: Post-Intervention (Optimized State)
- **Description:** Balanced workload using algorithm recommendations
  - All nurses assigned 6-7 patients
  - Acuity scores range from 12-16 (balanced)
  - Workload variance: 2.9
  - Compliance rate: 94%
- **Purpose:** Shows improved outcomes after dashboard implementation
- **Key Insight:** 40% reduction in average wait time (3.5 hours)

### How to Use Test Datasets

**Option 1: Built-in Mock Data (Recommended for Demo)**
```r
# No files needed - just run the app
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```
The dashboard automatically generates synthetic data representing the baseline scenario.

**Option 2: Upload Custom CSV Files (Advanced)**
1. Prepare two CSV files: `patients.csv` and `visits.csv`
2. Click "Upload Patient Data" in dashboard sidebar
3. Click "Upload Visit Data"
4. Dashboard will recalculate metrics based on your data

## 📖 Data Codebook

### Patient Data Structure

| Variable | Type | Description | Valid Values | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `patient_id` | String | Unique patient identifier | P001-P999 | "P042" |
| `room_number` | Integer | Assigned hospital room | 301-320 | 315 |
| `acuity_level` | Factor | Medical complexity level | High, Medium, Low | "High" |
| `assigned_nurse` | String | Primary nurse responsible | N01-N99 | "N12" |
| `admission_time` | POSIXct | Date/time of admission | ISO 8601 timestamp | "2025-10-15 14:30:00" |

**Acuity Level Definitions:**
- **High (3 points):** Immediate post-op, critical vitals, complex medications, high fall risk. *Threshold: 2 hours*
- **Medium (2 points):** Stable chronic conditions, routine IV medications, moderate mobility. *Threshold: 4 hours*
- **Low (1 point):** Pre-discharge observation, oral medications only, ambulatory. *Threshold: 6 hours*

### Visit Data Structure

| Variable | Type | Description | Valid Values | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `visit_id` | String | Unique visit identifier | V0001-V9999 | "V0042" |
| `patient_id` | String | Links to patients table | P001-P999 | "P042" |
| `staff_id` | String | Nurse/doctor conducting visit | N01-N99, D01-D99 | "N12" |
| `visit_time` | POSIXct | Timestamp of visit start | ISO 8601 timestamp | "2025-10-15 16:45:00" |
| `visit_duration_min` | Integer | Length of visit in minutes | 5-30 | 15 |

**Visit Type Coding (Implicit):**
- **5-10 min:** Medication administration, vital sign check
- **11-20 min:** Wound care, patient education, routine assessment
- **21-30 min:** Complex medication, physical therapy, family conference

### Dashboard Calculated Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation | Threshold |
|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `hours_since_last_visit` | `current_time - last_visit_time` | Time elapsed since patient last seen | Varies by acuity |
| `threshold` | IF High→2, Medium→4, Low→6 | Maximum acceptable wait time | Fixed per acuity |
| `exceeds_threshold` | `hours_since > threshold` | Boolean flag for violations | TRUE = Alert |
| `total_acuity_score` | `∑(High×3 + Medium×2 + Low×1)` per nurse | Nurse workload complexity | >20 = Overloaded |
| `compliance_rate` | `(Patients within threshold / Total) × 100` | Quality metric (%) | Target: >95% |
| `workload_variance` | `sd(acuity_scores)` | Staff workload balance | Target: <4.0 |

### Data Collection Protocol

**For Real Implementation:**
1. **Patient Admission:** Clerk enters demographics → EMR assigns `patient_id`
2. **Acuity Assessment:** Nurse completes form within 20 min → `acuity_level` assigned
3. **Visit Logging:** Nurse badges into room → Timestamp auto-captured → `visit_time` recorded
4. **Dashboard Sync:** EMR pushes data every 5 minutes → Dashboard recalculates metrics

## 🎬 Dashboard Demonstration

### Walkthrough: Critical Alert Response

**Starting Conditions:**
- 80 patients currently admitted
- Nurse N12 has 12 patients (28 acuity points) - OVERLOADED
- Patient P042 (High Acuity) has waited 9.5 hours since last visit

#### **Step 1: Launch Dashboard**
```r
# Install required packages (first time only)
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "dplyr", "readr", 
                   "DT", "shinyalert", "plotly", "lubridate"))

# Run the dashboard
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3838
```
Dashboard opens in your web browser automatically.

```

**Critical Alerts Table:**
| Patient | Room | Acuity | Wait Time | Nurse | Status |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| P042 | 315 | High | 9.5 hrs | N12 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| P037 | 308 | High | 5.2 hrs | N12 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| P058 | 319 | Medium | 7.1 hrs | N12 | 🟡 WARNING |

**Interpretation:** Nurse N12 has 3 patients in violation - workload clearly too high.

**Reassignment Recommendations Table:**
| Patient | Room | Acuity | From Nurse | To Nurse | Reason |
|---------|------|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| P058 | 319 | Low | N12 (28 pts) | N03 (8 pts) | Rebalance workload |
| P061 | 306 | Low | N12 (28 pts) | N04 (12 pts) | Rebalance workload |

---

#### **Step 4: Execute Reassignment**

**Charge Nurse Action:**
1. Reviews recommendation: Move P058 (Low Acuity) from N12 → N03
2. Confirms feasibility: N03 has capacity and is on same floor
3. Communicates change to both nurses via hospital radio
4. **(In real system):** Updates assignment in EMR

**Simulated in Dashboard:**
- Manually change `assigned_nurse` for P058 from "N12" to "N03" in data
- Dashboard auto-recalculates metrics

---

#### **Step 5: Verify Improvement**

**Updated Value Boxes:**
```
┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐

└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
```

**Updated Workload Chart:**
```

       (+1) (+0) (+0) (+0) (-1) (+0)
```

**New Variance:** 3.2 (down from 6.8) ✅

**Interpretation:**
- Alert count reduced from 3 → 2
- Compliance improved from 72% → 87%
- N12 now below overload threshold (25 → 19 points)
- N03 still has capacity (8 → 9 points)

---

#### **Step 6: Sustained Monitoring**

**After 2 Hours:**
- Nurse N12 completes visits to P042 and P037
- Both patients' timers reset
- Compliance rate reaches 94% ✅
- System returns to "OK" status 🟢

**End-of-Shift Summary:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Shift Performance Report (7am-3pm)      │

## 🔧 Key Functions & Technical Logic

### 1. Workload Calculation Algorithm
```r
# Calculate acuity-weighted workload per nurse
staff_workload <- patients_data() %>%
  group_by(assigned_nurse) %>%
  summarize(
    patients_assigned = n(),
    patients_high = sum(acuity_level == "High"),
    patients_medium = sum(acuity_level == "Medium"),
    patients_low = sum(acuity_level == "Low"),
    total_acuity_score = sum(
      case_when(
        acuity_level == "High" ~ 3,
        acuity_level == "Medium" ~ 2,
        acuity_level == "Low" ~ 1
      )
    ),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    overloaded = total_acuity_score > 20,
    underutilized = total_acuity_score < 10,
    status = case_when(
      overloaded ~ "OVERLOADED",
      underutilized ~ "UNDERUTILIZED",
      TRUE ~ "OK"
    )
  )
```

**Inputs:**
- `patients_data()`: Reactive dataframe with patient assignments
- Acuity levels: High (3 pts), Medium (2 pts), Low (1 pt)

**Output:**
- `total_acuity_score`: Sum of weighted patients per nurse
- `status`: Classification (OVERLOADED / OK / UNDERUTILIZED)

**Thresholds:**
- OVERLOADED: >20 acuity points
- UNDERUTILIZED: <10 acuity points
- OK: 10-20 acuity points

**Six Sigma Connection:** Based on capacity planning principles - assumes each nurse can handle ~15 acuity points optimally (±5 points tolerance).

---

### 2. Wait Time Monitoring
```r
# Calculate hours since last visit for each patient
wait_times <- patients_data() %>%
  left_join(
    visits_data() %>%
      group_by(patient_id) %>%
      arrange(desc(visit_time)) %>%
      slice(1) %>%
      select(patient_id, last_visit_time = visit_time),
    by = "patient_id"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    hours_since_last_visit = as.numeric(
      difftime(Sys.time(), last_visit_time, units = "hours")
    ),
    threshold = case_when(
      acuity_level == "High" ~ 2,
      acuity_level == "Medium" ~ 4,
      acuity_level == "Low" ~ 6
    ),
    exceeds_threshold = hours_since_last_visit > threshold,
    severity = case_when(
      hours_since_last_visit > (threshold * 1.5) ~ "CRITICAL",
      hours_since_last_visit > threshold ~ "WARNING",
      TRUE ~ "OK"
    )
  )
```

**Inputs:**
- Current system time: `Sys.time()`
- Last visit timestamp per patient
- Patient acuity level

**Output:**
- `hours_since_last_visit`: Elapsed time (decimal hours)
- `severity`: OK / WARNING / CRITICAL

**Thresholds:**
- High Acuity: 2 hours (CRITICAL if >3 hours)
- Medium Acuity: 4 hours (CRITICAL if >6 hours)
- Low Acuity: 6 hours (CRITICAL if >9 hours)

**Six Sigma Connection:** Control limits based on clinical standards of care (e.g., high-acuity patients require 2-hour assessments per Joint Commission guidelines).

### 3. Reassignment Recommendation Engine
```r
# Generate intelligent reassignment recommendations
recommendations <- reactive({
  sw <- staff_workload()
  
  # Identify overloaded and underutilized nurses
  overloaded <- sw %>% filter(overloaded) %>% pull(assigned_nurse)
  underutilized <- sw %>% filter(underutilized) %>% pull(assigned_nurse)
  
  # If no imbalance exists, return empty dataframe
  if (length(overloaded) == 0 | length(underutilized) == 0) {
    return(data.frame())
  }
  
  # Recommend moving LOW acuity patients first (easiest to transfer)
  patients_data() %>%
    filter(
      assigned_nurse %in% overloaded,
      acuity_level %in% c("Low", "Medium")  # Never move High acuity during shift
    ) %>%
    arrange(acuity_level) %>%  # Low patients first
    head(5) %>%  # Top 5 recommendations
    mutate(
      current_nurse = assigned_nurse,
      recommended_nurse = underutilized[1],  # Assign to first available nurse
      reason = "Rebalance workload"
    ) %>%
    select(patient_id, room_number, acuity_level, current_nurse, recommended_nurse, reason)
})
```

**Logic:**
1. Identify nurses with >20 acuity points (overloaded)
2. Identify nurses with <10 acuity points (underutilized)
3. Prioritize moving LOW acuity patients (minimize disruption)
4. Never recommend moving HIGH acuity patients mid-shift (safety risk)
5. Assign to first available underutilized nurse (could be enhanced with proximity logic)

**Six Sigma Connection:** Load balancing to minimize variance - goal is to bring all nurses within 10-20 acuity point range (within control limits).

---

### 4. Compliance Rate Calculation
```r
# Calculate percentage of patients receiving timely care
system_metrics <- reactive({
  wt <- wait_times()
  
  total_patients <- nrow(wt)
  compliant_patients <- sum(!wt$exceeds_threshold)
  compliance_rate <- (compliant_patients / total_patients) * 100
  
  return(round(compliance_rate, 1))
})
```

**Formula:**
```
Compliance Rate = (Patients Within Threshold / Total Patients) × 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- **>95%:** Target performance (Green)
- **85-95%:** Acceptable (Yellow)
- **<85%:** Requires immediate intervention (Red)

**Six Sigma Connection:** Process capability metric - analogous to "Defects Per Million Opportunities" (DPMO). Target of 95% compliance = 50,000 DPMO ≈ 3.2 sigma level.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny",
  "shinydashboard",
  "dplyr",
  "readr",
  "DT",
  "shinyalert",
  "plotly",
  "lubridate"
))
```

### Running the Dashboard
```r
# Save code as app.R
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX`

**Note:** Built-in mock data runs automatically—no CSV files needed for demo!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

**Error: `Package 'shiny' not found`**
```r
# Solution: Install missing package
install.packages("shiny")
```

**Error: `Cannot open file 'patients.csv'`**
- **Solution:** Use built-in mock data (no CSV files needed for demo)
- **OR** Ensure CSV is in your working directory:
```r
getwd()  # Check current directory
setwd("/path/to/your/files")  # Change if needed
```

**Dashboard won't load / blank screen**
- Check R version: `R.version.string` (need R 4.0+)
- Restart R session: `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (RStudio) or `Cmd+Shift+F10` (Mac)
- Check for package conflicts:
```r
detach("package:shiny", unload = TRUE)
library(shiny)
```

**Error: `object 'hours_since_last_visit' not found`**
- **Cause:** Mock data generation failed
- **Solution:** Check that `lubridate` package is loaded:
```r
library(lubridate)
```

### Performance Issues

**Dashboard is slow / laggy**
- Reduce mock data size from 80 → 40 patients
- Disable auto-refresh (remove `reactiveTimer` if added)
- Use `profvis` package to identify bottlenecks:
```r
profvis::profvis({
  shiny::runApp("app.R")
})
```

**"Error: Can't bind `<data>` because of column type"**
- **Cause:** Date formatting issue
- **Solution:** Ensure all timestamps use `POSIXct` format:
```r
visits$visit_time <- as.POSIXct(visits$visit_time)
```

## 🚨 Limitations & Assumptions

### Current Scope

**What This Tool DOES:**
✅ Monitors wait times in real-time  
✅ Calculates acuity-weighted workloads  
✅ Generates alerts for threshold violations  
✅ Recommends reassignments to balance workload  
✅ Tracks compliance rate and variance metrics  

**What This Tool DOES NOT Do:**
❌ Connect to live EMR systems (Epic, Cerner, etc.)  
❌ Automatically execute reassignments (requires human approval)  
❌ Predict future patient admissions  
❌ Track patient outcomes or clinical quality measures  
❌ Generate billing reports  

### Key Assumptions

1. **Acuity Levels Are Accurate**
   - Assumes nurses correctly classify patients as High/Medium/Low
   - In reality, acuity can change during stay (not currently tracked)

2. **Nurses Can Physically Relocate Between Rooms**
   - Assumes no geographic constraints (e.g., isolation units)
   - Ignores specialized equipment requirements (e.g., ventilators)

3. **Visit Durations Are Independent of Acuity**
   - Mock data assigns 5-30 min visits randomly
   - In reality, High acuity patients often require longer visits

4. **No Emergency Admissions During Shift**
   - Assumes patient census is stable within 8-hour shift
   - Real hospitals have continuous admissions/discharges

5. **Single Floor Monitoring (80 Beds)**
   - Currently scoped to Floor 3 only
   - Does not handle multi-floor coordination

6. **English Language Only**
   - Dashboard interface in English only
   - No internationalization (i18n) support

## Design Thinking + Six Sigma Integration

This project demonstrates the synergy between Design Thinking and Six Sigma:

| Design Thinking Stage | Six Sigma Phase | Our Application |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Empathize** | Define | Stakeholder interviews revealed human pain points |
| **Define** | Define | Framed problem as process deficiency, not resource shortage |
| **Ideate** | Measure | Brainstormed multiple solutions, selected data-driven approach |
| **Prototype** | Analyze + Improve | Built dashboard with acuity scoring and recommendations |
| **Test** | Improve + Control | Validated with mock data, established control metrics |

**Key Insight:** Design Thinking brought **empathy and user-centeredness** while Six Sigma brought **rigor and measurability**. The combination created a solution that is both human-centered AND data-driven.

### Six Sigma Methodology Applied

**Define Phase:**
- Charter: Reduce inpatient wait times from 5.8 hrs → <3.5 hrs
- VOC (Voice of Customer): Patient interviews revealed anxiety from unpredictable visits
- Problem Statement: 72% compliance (target: >95%)

**Measure Phase:**
- Primary Metric: Compliance Rate (patients within threshold)
- Secondary Metrics: Avg wait time, workload variance, staff turnover
- Data Collection: Synthesized mock data representing 80 patients, 6 nurses, 3 days

**Analyze Phase:**
- Fishbone Diagram: Identified lack of real-time monitoring as root cause
- Why-Why Analysis: 5 levels deep → No data-driven workload distribution system
- Pareto Analysis: 80% of violations caused by 20% of nurses (overloaded staff)

**Improve Phase:**
- Solution: Acuity-weighted assignment algorithm + real-time dashboard
- Pilot Test: Simulated 80 patients → 94% compliance achieved
- Control Charts: Established UCL/LCL for workload variance (<4.0 target)

**Control Phase:**
- SOP: Charge nurses review dashboard every 2 hours during shift
- Metrics: Track compliance rate, variance, avg wait time (real-time)
- Sustainment: Monthly quality reviews to ensure gains maintained
