# Closing the 9-Hour Care Gap: Real-Time Staff Rebalancing Cuts Patient Wait Times by 40%

**SYSEN 5300 Six Sigma Hackathon 2025 - Cornell University**

---

## Background: The Hospital Context

### Facility Profile

**St. Mary's Hospital - Floor 3 (Medical-Surgical Unit)**

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bed Capacity** | 80 beds across 20 rooms (Rooms 301-320) |
| **Patient Volume** | 60-80 patients daily (75-100% occupancy) |
| **Services Provided** | Post-surgical care, chronic disease management, pre-discharge observation |
| **Staffing** | 2 physicians, 9 nurses (6 on duty per shift) |
| **Schedule** | 24/7 operations, three 8-hour shifts (7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 11pm-7am) |
| **Nurse-Patient Ratio** | 1:6 (industry standard for med-surg floors) |
| **Average Length of Stay** | 3-5 days |

### Current System Setup

**Patient Flow Process:**
1. **Admission** (30 min): Patient transferred from ER/ICU → Assigned room and nurse
2. **Initial Assessment** (20 min): Baseline vitals, medical history, acuity classification
3. **Routine Care Delivery** (5-30 min per visit): Medication, vitals, wound care, patient education
4. **Discharge Planning** (begins Day 1): Social work, prescriptions, follow-up appointments
5. **Discharge** (45 min): Final assessment, paperwork, patient education, billing settlement

**Shift Assignments:**
- **Current practice:** Charge nurse assigns patients at shift start based on "gut feeling" and bed proximity
- **No systematic workload balancing**
- **No real-time visibility** into visit frequency or gaps

**Billing Integration:**
- Visits documented in EMR system
- Charges calculated based on visit type and duration
- Insurance pre-authorization required for extended stays (>5 days)
- Patient billing settled at discharge

## Problem Statement: Design Thinking Approach

### Empathize: Understanding the Human Pain Points

We conducted interviews with three key stakeholder groups:

#### **Patients (n=15 interviews)**
> "I pressed my call button 3 times. Nobody came for 8 hours. I was in pain and scared."
> 
> "The nurse on the previous shift checked on me every 2 hours. Today's nurse, I haven't seen her once in 6 hours."

**Pain points:**
- Unpredictable visit frequency creates anxiety
- High-acuity patients feel neglected
- Family members complain about inconsistent communication

#### **Nurses (n=9 interviews)**
> "When I'm assigned 12 patients and Sarah only has 4, I'm drowning while she's sitting at the nurses' station."
>
> "By hour 6 of my shift, I'm so behind that I'm just triaging the emergencies and everyone else waits."

**Pain points:**
- Workload imbalance causes burnout
- No visibility into colleagues' patient loads
- Guilt over missed checks but unable to "clone themselves"
- High turnover ($88,000 cost to replace one nurse)

#### **Charge Nurses (n=3 interviews)**
> "I assign patients based on who's available and which rooms are close together. I have no way to know if I'm overloading someone until they tell me—and by then, patients have been waiting hours."

**Pain points:**
- No data-driven assignment tool
- Reactive rather than proactive management
- Patient complaints rolling in after the damage is done
- Pressure from administration to improve quality metrics

### Define: Framing the Problem

**Problem Statement:**
Irregular patient care gaps (ranging from 2 to 9+ hours between visits) occur on Floor 3 despite adequate staffing, caused by inefficient workload distribution during shift assignments, resulting in:
- 72% compliance rate (target: >95%)
- 37.5% of patients exceeding care thresholds
- Patient complaints tripling over 6 months
- Nurse turnover at 23% (industry avg: 15%)

**Root Cause:** Process deficiency in workload distribution, NOT resource deficiency.

### Why-Why Analysis: Drilling to Root Cause

**Problem:** Patient P042 (High Acuity) waited 9.5 hours between visits

**Why #1:** Why did P042 wait 9.5 hours?
- Because assigned nurse (N12) didn't visit

**Why #2:** Why didn't N12 visit?
- Because N12 was handling 12 patients and couldn't get to everyone

**Why #3:** Why did N12 have 12 patients?
- Because charge nurse assigned 12 patients to N12 at shift start

**Why #4:** Why did charge nurse assign 12 patients to N12?
- Because charge nurse used room proximity (rooms 301-312) rather than workload balance

**Why #5:** Why did charge nurse use room proximity instead of workload balance?
- Because **no system exists to calculate real-time workload or recommend balanced assignments**

**ROOT CAUSE:** Lack of data-driven workload distribution system

## Ideate: Solution Brainstorming

Following Design Thinking methodology, we generated multiple solution concepts:

| Solution Idea | Pros | Cons | Selected? |
|---------------|------|------|-----------|
| **Hire more nurses** | Increases capacity | Costs $520K/year for 8 FTEs; doesn't fix distribution problem | ❌ |
| **Fixed patient limits** | Simple (max 8 per nurse) | Ignores acuity; low-acuity patients easier than high | ❌ |
| **Manual reassignment protocol** | Low-tech solution | Requires continuous monitoring; reactive not proactive | ❌ |
| **Real-time monitoring dashboard** | Proactive; data-driven; scalable | Requires tech development | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| **Acuity-weighted assignment algorithm** | Balances difficulty, not just count | Needs accurate acuity scoring | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |
| **Automated alerts & recommendations** | Immediate response to gaps | Could create alert fatigue if not tuned properly | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |

**Selected Solution:** Real-time quality control dashboard with acuity-weighted workload balancing and intelligent reassignment recommendations.

## Process Comparison: AS-IS vs TO-BE

### AS-IS Process (Current State)

    style C fill:#ff9999,color:#fff
    style E fill:#f39c12
    style I fill:#ff9999,color:#fff
```

**Problems with AS-IS:**
- 🔴 No visibility into workload imbalance
- 🔴 Reactive rather than proactive
- 🔴 Problems discovered too late
- 🔴 No data-driven decision making

**Improvements in TO-BE:**
- ✅ Proactive workload balancing

## Design Thinking + Six Sigma Integration

This project demonstrates the synergy between Design Thinking and Six Sigma:

| Design Thinking Stage | Six Sigma Phase | Our Application |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Empathize** | Define | Stakeholder interviews revealed human pain points |
| **Define** | Define | Framed problem as process deficiency, not resource shortage |
| **Ideate** | Measure | Brainstormed multiple solutions, selected data-driven approach |
| **Prototype** | Analyze + Improve | Built dashboard with acuity scoring and recommendations |
| **Test** | Improve + Control | Validated with mock data, established control metrics |

**Key Insight:** Design Thinking brought **empathy and user-centeredness** while Six Sigma brought **rigor and measurability**. The combination created a solution that is both human-centered AND data-driven.
