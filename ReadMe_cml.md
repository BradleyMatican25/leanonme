# Hospital Wait Time Quality Control System

**SYSEN 5300 Six Sigma Hackathon 2025 - Cornell University**

---

## Background

Healthcare quality begins with consistent, equitable care delivery. Yet in hospitals across the country, a persistent challenge undermines patient outcomes: **wide and irregular gaps in nurse and doctor visits during inpatient stays**.

On Floor 3 of our hospital, patients report experiences ranging from visits every 2 hours to waits exceeding 9 hours—despite having adequate staffing levels (5 nurses, industry-standard 6:1 ratio). This isn't a headcount problem; **it's a coordination and workload distribution problem**.

The consequences are severe:
- **For patients:** Delayed responses to deterioration, extended hospital stays, lower satisfaction
- **For staff:** Burnout from overwork or disengagement from underutilization  
- **For the hospital:** Poor quality metrics, increased costs, regulatory risk

That's why our team developed this **real-time quality control monitoring system**—a lightweight, data-driven tool that ensures every patient receives timely, equitable care using existing staff resources.

## Problem Flow: Root Cause Analysis

Understanding why this problem exists is key to solving it. Our analysis identified a clear causal chain from inefficient job distribution to quality and cost issues:

```

**The core insight:** This is a **process problem**, not a resource problem. Better coordination can solve it without hiring a single additional staff member.

|:-------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------|
| **High** | 2 hours | Critical patients requiring constant monitoring for deterioration |
| **Medium** | 4 hours | Standard inpatient care needs with moderate risk |
| **Low** | 6 hours | Stable patients with minimal intervention needs |

### Alert Severity Levels

- 🟢 **OK:** Patient seen within threshold → No action needed
- 🟡 **WARNING:** Patient 1-1.5× over threshold → Schedule visit soon
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** Patient >1.5× over threshold → **Immediate action required**

**Example:**
- High acuity patient (2 hr threshold):
  - <2.0 hrs: 🟢 OK
  - 2.0-3.0 hrs: 🟡 WARNING
  - >3.0 hrs: 🔴 CRITICAL

## Six Sigma Connection

This project demonstrates core Six Sigma principles and methodologies:

### DMAIC Framework

Our solution follows the classic Six Sigma improvement cycle:

| Phase | Our Application |
|-------|----------------|
| **Define** | Irregular patient visit gaps causing quality issues due to workload distribution |
| **Measure** | Track wait times, workload variance, compliance rates, acuity scores |
| **Analyze** | Root cause = inefficient workload distribution, not total staffing capacity |
| **Improve** | Real-time monitoring and intelligent rebalancing system |
| **Control** | Dashboard for ongoing monitoring, trend analysis, and continuous improvement |

### Key Methodologies Applied

- **Statistical Process Control (SPC):** Monitoring metrics against control limits
- **Variation Reduction:** Decreased workload variance from 6.8 → 2.9
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Problem flow diagram identifying causal chain
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Objective metrics for reassignment recommendations
- **Process Improvement:** Better coordination without resource addition
- **Voice of the Customer:** Addressing patient complaints about inconsistent care

### Why This Is Six Sigma

**Traditional approach:** "We need more nurses!" (adds cost, doesn't fix root cause)

**Six Sigma approach:** "We need better process control" (reduces variation, fixes root cause)

Our tool demonstrates that **quality problems can be solved through process improvement**, not just resource addition—a core Six Sigma principle.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### For Charge Nurses

**Q: What if a reassignment recommendation doesn't make clinical sense?**

A: Always use your clinical judgment. The system recommends based on acuity scores and workload balance, but you know patient-specific factors like nurse-patient rapport, family dynamics, and complex care needs. Override recommendations when appropriate.

**Q: How do I actually reassign a patient after the dashboard recommends it?**

A: This dashboard is a monitoring and recommendation tool. After identifying a reassignment need:
1. Review the recommendation
2. Confirm it makes clinical sense
3. Communicate with both nurses
4. Update the assignment in your hospital's EHR system
5. Click "Refresh Data" to update the dashboard

**Q: What if multiple alerts appear at once?**

A: Triage by:
1. **Severity:** CRITICAL before WARNING
2. **Acuity:** High-acuity patients first
3. **Duration:** Longest gaps first
The critical alerts table is pre-sorted by urgency.

---

### For Nurse Managers

**Q: Can I use this data for performance evaluations?**

A: Use with caution. Workload imbalance often reflects assignment decisions by charge nurses, not individual nurse performance. Use data to:
- ✅ Identify systematic issues
- ✅ Support struggling staff
- ✅ Adjust schedules and protocols
- ❌ NOT to punish individual nurses

**Q: How do I export data for monthly reports?**

A: Currently the dashboard is for real-time use. For reports, you can:
1. Take screenshots of key metrics
2. Note values at specific times (start/end of month)
3. Export patient details table using browser tools
4. Future version will include built-in reporting

---

### For IT/Administrators

**Q: Can we integrate this with our EHR system?**

A: Yes, with IT support. The tool reads standard CSV formats. Any system that can export patient and visit data can feed this dashboard. Integration would require:
1. Automated CSV export from EHR
2. Scheduled data refresh
3. Potentially direct database connection

**Q: What about HIPAA compliance?**

A: The dashboard displays only necessary clinical identifiers (patient ID, room, acuity). For HIPAA compliance:
- Deploy behind hospital firewall
- Use secure authentication
- Follow hospital's data security protocols
- Consider de-identifying data for demos

**Q: Can this scale to multiple floors?**

A: Yes! Simply:
1. Add a "floor" column to patient data
2. Filter dashboard by floor
3. Or create separate dashboard instances per floor
